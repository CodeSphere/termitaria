= HOW TO INSTALL TERMITARIA =

1. Run the Termitaria.sql script. The script is located in TermitariaOM/WebContent/setup directory. This will create your databases: om, cm, ts and audit.
2. Configure for each module the jdbc parameters
	In JavaSource/config/jdbc.properties, you will have to specify the:
		<module>.jdbc.url=jdbc\:mysql\://localhost\:3306/<module>
		<module>.jdbc.username=root
		<module>.jdbc.password=password
3. Create the following folders 
(or change folder path in config.properties and applicationContext.xml of each of the 3 modules):
	C:\Termitaria\attachmentCacheDirTS
	C:\Termitaria\attachmentCacheDirAUDIT
	C:\Termitaria\attachmentCacheDirCM
4. Add all your projects on Tomcat Server: TermitariaOM, TermitariaCM, TermitariaTS and TermitariaAudit.   

5. You might need to increase Tomcat's startup time to more than 45 seconds (try at least 100 seconds).
	5.1 Open Tomcat's Server Config Editor: double click on Tomcat Server from the Servers View
	5.2 In the Timeouts section, increase the Start (in seconds) value

6. We also recommend to increase Tomcat's memory (-XX:MaxPermSize=1024m -XX:PermSize=512m).
	6.1 Open Tomcat's Server Config Editor: double click on Tomcat Server from the Servers View
	6.2 From the General Information Section, click on Open launch configuration
	6.3 Click on the (x)=Arguments tab
	6.4 Add in the VM Arguments box, after the last line the following configuration: -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m -XXermSize=512m 

7. Access the application at the following url: http://localhost:8080/TermitariaOM using the default credentials: adminIT/password.
   AdminIT is the super administrator. Using adminIT you can add as many organizations and users as you please. After adding an 
   organization, you can add an administrator for that organization.
   Logged in as that new created organization's administrator you can build more (adding more people, departments, etc).
